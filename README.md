# MLR English translation

[MLR](https://vk.com/mylittleaddon) is a popular Russian addon for [Call of Chernobyl](http://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-chernobyl).  It's also often seen merged into popular mods like [Last Day](http://www.moddb.com/company/stalker-last-day) and [A.R.E.A](https://vk.com/fridgemodpack).

This is a WIP translation for MLR.  It uses a machine translation as the base and layers the Last Day hand translation over it.

### Credits
The Last Day Translation team for their excellent hand translation.
