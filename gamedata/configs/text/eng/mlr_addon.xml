    <text>I moved from the Agroprom, promoted me. Before he got to the Zone, he was an auto mechanic. Appreciate my hands in the group, so they decided to translate here. I prefer heavy and assault weapons, snipers I hate in terms of upgrades.</text>

	<string id="story_dolg_m_2">
    <text>And then the bottles are so close, Duty is for a healthy lifestyle ?.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_m_3">
    <text>I can, work tiresome, and boring here - just do not go back, there is no base on the Agroprom. Although I do not know, I would have been alive then, they say the base was lost during the release in 2011. Something we have moved away from the topic, do not be shy, give your toys here.</text>

    <text>What can you say about the Cold?</text>

	<string id="story_b_cs_1">
    <text>And what can I say, the guys consider his views on the groupings correct.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_2">
    <text>And what did he gain such "love"?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_3">
    <text>You know, Lebedev, though I did not find him, but people began to dislike him. He did not take an interest in the opinion of the members of the group when he moved them on the very last campaign. That mercenary certainly helped us, but it was not worth the "candle-ovchinka." Those who stayed at the base could not do anything with the reinforcements of this rabble returning after the defeat of the "renegades". The meaning of the capture of the Bolot was reduced to zero, the sacrifices also turned out to be in vain both on the way to the Chernobyl NPP, and here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_4">
    <text>I think the indignation of the guys about the former leader becomes clear.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_5">
    <text>Listen further... Upon the return of the remnants of the detachment, we had to conduct a protracted struggle and return everything back. We ourselves would not be able to manage ourselves in life, The cold through the familiar "free" stalkers came out to the guys from Svalka and Cordon, helped the loners and the charisma of the new leader. Moreover, he gave the floor to all fighters without exception, not to leave from here. Any help, but not the life of our guys.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_6">
    <text>You know, whoever Lebedev was, but you have already ceased to be that grouping that was originally.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_7">
    <text>Well, this is your opinion, not devoid of meaning. There are no global goals for us now, as an even count and common views. So, it's time to tie with fables and probably buy something.</text>

    <text>By virtue of the profession, I collect all sorts of stories, once I have come up with pseudo-phrases. At the very approaches to the Station there is a place similar to our Marshes, called Zaton.

	<string id="aslan_st_0">
    <text>How and what is the best way to go to work.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_1">
    <text>Look here: the "syndicate" in the Zone has only one central base - ours. The path is cut off to the South, again the psi-installation on Yantar works and crowds of zombarees sometimes from there in an embrace with mutants. Limansk in the North is occupied by us, but beyond the place of the dying - a continuous labyrinth and fanatics. In the East, Army Warehouses, the territory of Liberty.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_2">
    <text>[more...]</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_3">
    <text>As for the dangers, you'll appreciate yourself, but keep in mind: when you carry out orders - you're at work and feeling with snot throw out or put on the shelf, no morality - just calculation. About the trails, through Limansk, the safest in terms of displacement. The space there is closed, the sniper can not lead you, the shelters are full of both ejection and in case of a prolonged shootout. There are also disadvantages - this is the unpredictability of the terrain, you do not know what is waiting around the corner.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_4">
    <text>You say the base is central, there are still outposts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_5">
    <text>Of all the known I have three small dots. The first on the Zaton, at the edge of the boundless foul "northern" marshes. The second is on the devil on cake, on the outskirts of Pripyat. And we also had a group, among which the supply agent is behind the bridge to Limansk, on the outskirts of the "Red Forest". You can also meet our groups throughout the Zone during the execution of various contracts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_6">
    <text>Behind the Limansk is already the territory of the "Monolith", as I understand it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_7">
    <text>The hospital there is old, but there's no point in climbing there - the track at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, as well as the Amber Plant is cut off by psy-radiation. As you will find yourself in Limansk, keep your way to the South, but get covered with ammunition and first-aid kits.</text>

	<string id="sultan_st_0">
    <text>Tell me about yourself.</text>

	<string id="sultan_st_1">
    <text>Listen carefully. I'm a local groom, you already know my name. Not so long ago I came here from Zaton and brought guys with me. We got rid of the mutants from here and revived the base. On Zaton I was thrown by one devil. I pretended to be my own and framed it. I had to fuck out from there.</text>

    <text>Absolutely without concepts, scuffles were pushed, pakhanov thrown. As this chmoshnika called then, in case of ass I'll tear it.</text>

	<string id="sultan_st_7">
    <text>Listen carefully. From the North from us, the Cemetery of Technology, our little patrols there on the old checkpoint near the road and the exits from the Army Depots are held, in the Cemetery, try not to walk at night and generally get past the old ones. The background there is cracking sometimes so that the ringing of eggs in your pants is heard, plus the anomalies around and "zverushki" local do not slumber. From the West Dump, there is an anarchy full and I will not be able to tell you anything specific about it, I know for sure about the blockhouse of the debtors in the north. In the south, a huge grove is there, the Dark Hollow is called, the wilderness - the soldiers there periodically patrol and stalkery tusuet. About Loshchinu forgot to say, on the approach to it, but we already on the farm of the old stalkers eyes callus, neater. The Grove has a huge plus, the road and the exit from it lead to the Cordon, you will find ours without problems. On the cordon ATP old try to keep.</text>

    <text>How did you fuck my ears, I will tell you so. Before my first walk at Sovkoy, my story has its roots. I wanted to live beautiful. He traded in speculation, he fell asleep on a deal and got caught in jail. The period of its winding began dating new to look for, found new kents and stolen traded. I lived like this for three years - then again. I leaned back, but the "scoop" is gone. And do you know what the most zashtvarnoe?</text>

Somehow we bumped with a cant, I do not even remember what happened because of what. In general, I screwed it with a screwdriver, it's good that he did not skimp. They gave me a few years of planter. The bitch's wife, while I was sitting, sold everything and was gone. He leaned back when he drove the house and everything that was left in it. He drank money for a long time and after that looted him. As the Zone formed, decided to tug here, everyone is equal - all the whips are the same. I went to the thieves at the Landfill, evaluating me as a local mechanic allowed to stay. The best time in my life, trunks and vodka was dragged by boxes.</text>

	<string id="loki_st_4">
    <text>Tell me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_5">
    <text>Good. When the "Scorcher" was disconnected, my detachment launched a campaign to the North. They walked for a long time, wild places around. As the horizon ChNPP loomed, a place for the camp began to grow. They found this station abandoned and settled there. Then the Zone began to fever and the "Debt" appeared. The places are unfamiliar, there are few people, and the emissions have become frequent. After concluding a truce, they agreed on the Station to keep weapons in the holster and knives in the scabbard.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_6">
    <text>And where are these debtors now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_7">
    <text>No them, who did not have time to shoot, they themselves fled. Not so long ago we had a stalker looming alone, Sasha was called. He helped us a lot, did a lot of good things. But the last straw was information from the CCP of their founder, judging by which "Debt" was founded by former military forces on a forced basis. Their captain (now deceased "general") simply broke off communication with the headquarters. This is what infuriated the local stalkery, exactly as puzzled some of the enemy fighters. At us after all as at station was: especially balance. And after the help of that stalker and the soldiers we had, as if straight from the air, and the defectors with the sympathizers was full. Here we are by force "Duty" from here and expelled.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_8">
    <text>And where did this Stalker go?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_9">
    <text>I do not know, but the last time he was seen together with the "company" was going to the side of "Jupiter". And I did not care for him, to be honest.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_10">
    <text>Tell me about the surroundings. Why be afraid?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_11">
    <text>The beast is full. And if frankly, then we missed the "Monolith", had time to bastards to settle in the depot old. In general, they have a decent base there. In the north in Kopachi are full of zombies, in the area of the ventilation complex and the "Volkhov" air defense system there are also a lot of them, keep your eyes open.</text>
