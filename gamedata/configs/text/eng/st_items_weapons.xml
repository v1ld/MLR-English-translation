The penetrator is made from hardened steel and usually separates from the jacket when hitting armor plate or other hard barriers. When fired, the penetrator goes inside the target while the jacket remains outside of the barrier/armor plate, when hitting soft armor or body tissue, the SP-6 bullet normally stays intact, thus ensuring conformity with international conventions on warfare. Penetration for the SP-6 cartridge is usually listed as 7-8 mm of mild steel at 100 meters.</text>

The 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge was introduced to the military for rifles and machine guns. The U.S. used this round for their M14 rifle and M60 LMG in the late 1950s. Fabrique Nationale's FAL became the most popular 7.62x51mm NATO rifle in Europe and served well into the early 1980s. The M14 was superseded by the 5.56x45mm M16 in U.S. however, the M14 and many other firearms that use the 7.62x51mm NATO round remain in service, especially in the case of sniper rifles and machine guns. The round is used by infantry, ground vehicles, aircraft and ships. While similar in appearance, 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge is not identical to the commercial .308 Winchester however, their interchangeability is not listed as unsafe in either combination. Some confuse the round with the 7.62x39mm intermediate cartridge used in the AK-47/AKM and other weapons, because both are referred simply as "7.62". They are not interchangeable.</text>

Following the Project Abakan Advanced Assault Rifle Trials in the USSR throughout the 1980s, Gennadiy Nikonov's system outperformed its rivals significantly, proving it better than the AEK-971 and the AKB-1. The Nikonov AN-94 was commissioned for general issue to the Soviet armed forces, with mass production to be carried out by the Izhmash state factories. Presently, the AN-94 is issused in limited quantities to the elite forces of the Russian Army, police and Internal Affairs Ministry due to its rather complicated design and production cost. The AN-94 offers a unique two-shot burst function at 1800 rounds per minute; mechanism fires the second shot in the burst quickly enough before the recoil of the first shot is felt, potentially allowing the two shots to hit extremely close together.</text>

Koksharov. Originally designed and tested during the Abakan trials of the late 1980s, it failed in the trials but its development was continued in hopes to sell the gun to police forces and for export. During the early 2000s small batches of AEK-971 rifles in 5.45x39 caliber were manufactured for Russian MVD troops, but has since then seen extremely limited production. Based on previous AK rifles in internal design and layout, the AEK-971 is also equipped with a recoil balancing mechanism by way of a counter weight that negates the impulse of the gas piston and bolt carrier, resulting in more controllable automatic fire.</text>

Mikhail Kalashnikov designed this automatic rifle combining the best features of the American M1 and the German StG44. The Kalashnikov is a gas operated 7.62x39 assault rifle and by far the most prolific small arm of the 2nd half of the 20th century. It had been and still is, in more or less modified form, manufactured in dozens of countries and has been used in hundreds of conflicts since its introduction.</text>

The major design is attributed to the three men - Horst Wesp, Karl Wagner and Karl Moser, who developed most of the rifle features. The new rifle has been adopted by the Austrian Army in 1977 as the Stg.77, and production began in 1978. Since then, the AUG gained large popularity, being adopted by the armed forces of Australia, Austria, New Zealand, Oman, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Ireland. It also was widely purchased by various security and law enforcement agencies worldwide, including the US Coastal Guard.

The PM rifle won the competition and was accepted by the British Army under the designation of L96. One of the most notable features of the PM rifle was the design of the stock. Instead of the solid polymer or wooden stock, PM/L96 rifle used a hollow polymer stock, made from two halves and assembled aroundaluminium bedding block, that extends through entire stock length.

It is designed to use the 7.62x51mm NATO round, and uses a Roller-delayed blowback action. The rifle owes its design to the CETME mod. A, which was designed by the german engineer Dr. Ludwig Vorgrimler. In 1957, Heckler & Koch bought the license to manufacture the rifle, where small modifications were made to the CETME design. Officially adopted into service in 1959, by the Bundeswehr as the G3, it remained in service until 1995 when it was replaced by the G36. Despite having been officially replaced by the German army, it is still in limited use. The G3 is also a popular rifle among militaries all over the world, among a few nations that use it are: Greece, Angola, Denmark, Iceland, Gabon, Lebanon, Iran, Mexico, Morocco, Norway, Phillipines, Turkey, and Sweden.</text>

In 1911, after extensive testing, the new pistol and its cartridge were adopted for U.S. military service as the M1911. Prior to and during World War 1, more than a million were manufactured, mostly by Colt and Springfield Armory, as well as by Remington-UMC, Burroughs, Savage and other companies. The rights to manufacture Colt/Browning design were also sold to some foreign countries, such as Norway and Argentina. In 1926, the original design was improved following the recommendations of the US Army Ordinance Dept. These changes incorporated: a wider front sight, longer hammer spur, shorter trigger, curved spring housing, simplified grip panels checkering, index finger reliefs behind the trigger, and a longer grip-safety spur.

Currently, this gun is issued to the Ukrainian police and security forces and also sold on civilian market chambered for non-lethal rubber or tear gas ammunition. Early production Fort-12 pistols were reported as marginally reliable but today, most of the teething problems are gone and it provides improvements over the older Makarov PM in ergonomics, accuracy and magazine capacity.</text>

After the cancellation of the G11 and G41 projects, the Bundeswehr was left with outdated G3 rifles; Heckler&Koch was set to develop a new assault rifle for both the German army and for export. The new 5.56x45mm assault rifle was adopted by the Bundeswehr in 1995 and also found its way into the hands of various law enforcement agencies worldwide, including British police and some US police departments. So far, there have been very few complaints about this rifle. The more common ones being the overheating of the handguards during sustained fire, and the loss of zero on the built in scope of G36KE rifles. Some German soldiers also complained about the position of the dual optical sights and it being easily fogged in bad weather. Otherwise, it is accurate, reliable and simple in maintenance</text>

It was intended for various special forces in the Russian Army and Internal Affairs Ministry as an dedicated urban warfare weapon. Briefly manufactured in small numbers at the Tula Arms factory during the mid-1990s, the OTs-14 saw action in Chechnya in 1999, but fell out of favor and are no longer being made. The gun is based on the familiar AKS-74U receiver and action, modified for the larger 9x39mm subsonic ammunition favored by various Spetsnaz troops. It is a bullpup design, with removable foregrip which can be replaced with a 40mm grenade launcher. When firing the grenade launcher, a single trigger controls both the 40mm GL and the rifle with a separate barrel selector. The safety/fire mode selector of Kalashnikov rifles is retained but in bullpup layout and is quite uncomfortable to operate. The barrel can be fitted with a detachable suppressor. Standard open sights are built into the carry handle, resulting in a short sight base; the carry handle also has mounting points for telescope, red dot or night sights.</text>

It is based on ideas of American firearms inventor John Browning, created and patented in 1922, later patented by FN Herstal. Browning died in 1926, before he had finished developing a production version, but FN arms designer Dieudonne Saive fully developed it. The Hi-Power pistol was noted for its 13 round magazine capacity, twice that of contemporary designs such as the Luger or Mauser 1910. It also had the first functional double column magazine, holding 13 cartridges, 14 if counting round in the chamber. Flush fit 15 round magazines are available today, as extended magazines that extend past the end of the grip. The pistol is often referred to as HP for "Hi-Power" or "High-Power" or as GP in French term, "Grande Puissance", P-35 is also used, based on the introduction of the pistol in 1935, another common nickname being "King of Nines". This modified variant of the Browning HP pistol, despite its venerable age, enjoys popularity around the world.</text>

Testing the H&K 416 in 2004 revealed that the piston operating system significantly reduces malfunctions while increasing the life of parts. The project was originally called the HK M4, but was changed in response to a trademark infringement suit filed by Colt Defense. It is speculated that "416" is a reference to the M4 and M16 it's designed to succeed. So far, the weapon has been tested by the United States military as well as some law enforcement agencies.

When NATO trials were announced in 1977 to select a new cartridge, Enfield Small Arms Factory developed its own small caliber, high velocity round, which was more or less representing the US .223/5.56x45mm case necked down to accept 4.85mm (0.19 inch) bullet. When the cartridge came out, Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield developed a new weapon around it, designated as SA80-IW or XL65. Original SA80 weapons both L85 and L86 were plagued with many problems, they were unreliable and troublesome to handle and maintain. Finally, in 1997 after years of constant complaints from the troops, it was decided to upgrade the L85 rifles in service. The current L85A2 rifles are recognized as reliable and accurate, especially when using standard issue SUSAT telescope sights.</text>

The original LR-300 rifles were designed by Alan Zitta as an upgrade to the well known and popular M16/AR-15 rifles. In fact, LR-300 and Para TTR both use standard AR-15 type lower receivers; only the upper receivers are different and contain patented modified gas system. The key reason for tha modification was to provide the weapon with capability to mount side folding stock rather than partially collapsible stock. Z-M Weapons intended its rifles mostly for military and law enforcement personnel, by offering LR-300-ML with short barrels and select fire capability. With excellent ergonomics and lightweight, this weapon is highly accurate but it is sensitive to dirt and is not ideal for difficult field conditions.</text>

Today, it is in use with some police and state security units of the Russian Federation. The niche for the PP-2000 is a personal defense weapon for non-infantry military personnel, as well as close combat weapon for special forces and special law enforcement teams. As such, it is a compact weapon with few parts for reliability, simplified maintenance and low cost. The PP-2000 is fitted with fixed open sights and a Picatinny rail on the top of the receiver cover. This weapon is most often encountered with various types of red dot sights.

        <text>The PB (Pistolet Besshumnyj or Silent Pistol), also known in the Soviet army as 6P9, has been developed in 1967 for Spetsnaz units of the Soviet Army, as well as for KGB operatives. The pistol is based on a modified Makarov PM pistol and features an unique integral two part suppressor. The rear part of the suppressor is fixed around the barrel, which is drilled to decrease the muzzle velocity to subsonic. The front part of the suppressor is detachable, so that the pistol can be broken down into two parts for convenient carry. Unlike other integrally suppressed pistols, the PB can be safely fired with the suppressor removed, but this will greatly increase the sound, a useful emergency feature. Because the front of the barrel is enclosed into the suppressor, the slide is very short and cannot contain the return spring, instead the return spring is located in the grip. The double-action firing unit with external hammer and slide mounted safety/decocker, as well as the magazine, are borrowed from the Makarov PM pistol.</text>

        <text>The Makarov PM is a semi automatic pistol designed in the late 1940s, by Nikolai Fyodorovich Makarov, and was the Soviet Union's standard military sidearm from 1951-1991. The Makarov pistol resulted from a design competition for replacing the Tokarev TT-33 pistol. Rather than building a pistol around an existing cartridge, Nikolai Makarov designed a new cartridge, the 9x18mm Makarov. For simplicity and economy, the Makarov pistol was a straight blowback operation, with the 9x18mm cartridge being the most powerful cartridge that the design could safely fire. Interestingly, although the caliber is 9mm, the actual bullet is 9.3mm in diameter - shorter and wider, incompatible with pistols chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum. Consequently, Soviet pistol rounds were unusable for NATO pistols, the theory being in war NATO would be unable to use ammunition from killed or captured Soviet soldiers or from Soviet ammunition dumps. In 1951, the Pistol Makarova was selected because of its simplicity, easy manufacturing, accuracy, and reasonable stopping power. It remained in service with Soviet military and police until the end of the U.S.S.R. in 1991. Today, the Makarov is a popular handgun for concealed carry in US. Variants of the Makarov remain in production in Russia and Bulgaria.</text>

The RG-6 entered limited production by mid-1990s and is now in use by various elements of the Russian Army and special forces, as well as by special forces in MVD (Internal Affairs Ministry). The RG-6 is designed to fire all standard 40mm caseless grenades, available for general issue underbarrel launchers, such as GP-25 and GP-30. These rounds include VOG-25 fragmentation grenade, VOG-25P bouncing fragmentation grenade and "Gvozd" (Nail) nonlethal tear gas grenade for riot control.

As a squad support weapon, the PKM compliments the existing array of assault rifles. A bipod is fitted to the underside of the barrel for stabilized support and can be folded up when portability is required. A carrying handle is added top the barrel towards the middle of the weapon to make transition fast. The weapon's feed system is similar to that found on the AK systems before it, and can fire from a 100, 200 or 250 round belt either fired as a free fed belt or held in a box. For overheating concerns, the barrel is designed to be replaceable, necessary when sustained fire of upwards of 650 rounds per minute is reached.

By far, RPG-7 can be considered as one of the most successful anti-tank grenade launchers ever made. Initially thought of as an anti-armor weapon, it was later adopted for other fire support missions with the introduction of other types of grenades, such as anti-infantry HE-FRAG and multi-purpose Thermobaric/FAE. The RPG-7 is a shoulder fired, single shot, smoothbore recoilless launcher, grenades are loaded from the front, and the rear of the barrel is fitted with venturi nozzle. Due to the recoilless design, the backblast is dangerous. The RPG-7 is usually issued with 2.7X fixed magnification optical sight, designated PGO-7. It is a simple and inexpensive, but possess a high threat to modern tanks and can also serve in a number of other roles, making it a flexible weapon.</text>

Extensive testing of the rifles in variable environmental conditions resulted in Dragunov’s design being accepted into service in 1963. At the same time an initial pre-production batch of 200 rifles was assembled and from 1964, serial production was carried out at Izhmash.

It is the American adaptation of the Belgian FN Minimi. The M249 has seen action in every major conflict involving the United States since the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989. Soldiers are generally satisfied with the weapon's performance, though there have been reports of clogging with dirt and sand.</text>

U.S. law enforcement and military provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by famous designs like the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible. Using a modified Browning type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the recoil effects on components are reduced and for the shooter as well. The modular design of the internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left handed shooters. It can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another, double action and single action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes. </text>

The AS-VAL is a gas operated, integrally suppressed weapon. The receiver is machined from steel forging for improved strength. It has a standard side-mounted rail for optical, night vision or red dot scopes but has no provision for mounting a bayonet or a grenade launcher. The integral suppressor could be easily detached for maintenance, repair, or compact storage, but the rifle should not be fired with the suppressor removed due to safety and reliability issues.</text>

Borisov and V. Levchenko in early 1990s. Initially known as "MA" (Malogabaritnyj Avtomat - small size assault rifle), it was based on the suppressed 9x39mm AS-Val assault rifle, and intended for concealed carry by special VIP protection teams and State Security operatives. The SR-3 is widely used by various FSO (Federal Protection Service) and FSB (Federal Security Service) operatives. Following the demand from users, the TsNIITochMash recently developed an improved version of the SR-3, with the intent to produce a more versatile weapon for law enforcement use. The new SR-3M compact assault rifle features more convenient fire controls and charging handle, integrated folding forward grip and a specially developed detachable suppressor and a standard side rail for mounting day or night optics. SR-3M also has a larger capacity of 30 rounds, which also provides more reliable feeding during automatic fire. Open sights consist of a protected front post and a flip up rear sight with U-notch, with settings for 100 and 200 meters range.</text>

The VSS is quite popular among its users for its stealthy capabilities and the great lethality of the heavy 9x39mm bullets. The effective range of the VSS is limited to 300-400 meters. The VSS is a gas operated, select fire weapon, the suppressor is integrated as part of the weapon but it can be easily removed for storage or maintenance. The VSS should not be fired with its suppressor removed due to safety and reliability issues. Standard sighting equipment consists of side rail on the receiver, which usually accommodates the 4x PSO-1M2-01 scope. Any other scope or night vision sight can be mounted on the appropriate mount. Backup iron sights consist of tangent rear and blade front. The rear sight is graduated for up to 400 meters. The gun uses a polymer 10 or 20 round magazines.</text>

The development of a new pistol started in 1994 and the first production pistols were shown to the public in '97. The earliest pistols were made in 9x19mm, and a .40 S&W version appeared in '99. By 2004, Walther presented the second generation of the P-99 pistols. These new guns had better ergonomics and new model designations. As the sidearm for law enforcement agencies in North America, Europe and Asia, the P-99 has endured some of the harshest operating conditions a handgun will ever see. It is truly a world class handgun for professionals who must trust their lives to a firearm.</text>

In fact, the model 1300 was a slightly modified version of the previous Winchester model 1200 shotgun, which was manufactured by Olin/Winchester between 1964 and 1980. The Winchester 1300 shotgun is also known as the "Speed Pump" because of the very fast cycling pump action, which makes these guns popular among both hunters and sport shooters. This shotgun also works well for home defense and security purposes, especially with availability of relatively short barreled models with long magazines.</text>
